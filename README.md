## App to Demo the Lineup Display Application (LDA)
The LDA is a tool for sharing fantasy football lineups.  The actual application will poll a web service every minute to check if the lineup data has changed and make updates if it has.  The demo simulates over 400 minutes of NFL data pulled on 9/22/2019.
